# EduVos Coding Club
This is my repo for all of the challenges that I do for EduVos's coding club.

## Setup
First clone the repo, and go into the directory.
```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Subarctic2796/EduVos-Coding-Club.git
cd EduVos-Coding-Club
```
Then go into the directory for the challenge you want to look at and then run
```bash
make run
```
for either the frontend or backend part of the challenge.
